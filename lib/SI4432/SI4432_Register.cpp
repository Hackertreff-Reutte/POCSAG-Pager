        When set to 1 the TX or RX FIFO has overflowed or underflowed.

6       itxffafull (R) TX FIFO Almost Full.
        When set to 1 the TX FIFO has met its almost full threshold and needs to
        be transmitted.

5       itxffaem (R) TX FIFO Almost Empty.
        When set to 1 the TX FIFO is almost empty and needs to be filled.

4       irxffafull (R) RX FIFO Almost Full.When set to 1 the RX FIFO has met its 
        almost full threshold and needs to be read by the microcontroller.

3       iext (R) External Interrupt.
        When set to 1 an interrupt occurred on one of the GPIOâ€™s if it is 
        programmed so. The status can be checked in register 0Eh. 7
        See GPIOx Configuration section for the details.

4       irssi (R) RSSI.
        When RSSI level exceeds the programmed threshold this bit will be set 7
        to 1.

3       iwut (R) Wake-Up-Timer.
        On the expiration of programmed wake-up timer this bit will be set to 1.

2       ilbd (R) Low Battery Detect.
        When a low battery event is been detected this bit will be set to 1. 
        This interrupt event is saved even if it is not enabled by the mask 
        register bit and causes an interrupt after it is enabled.
